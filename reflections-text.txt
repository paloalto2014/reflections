How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

because I can always return to a version where things are not yet broken. also I can look up all the changes that let to the broken version and refactor them.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would like to see how diff works now

check for remote git: $ git remote
add a remote: $ git remote add 'name' 'git-url'
push content to git: $ git push 'name' 'branch'
